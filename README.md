# Front End Website Wisata App using Nuxt.js

Wisata App is website to booking hotel. In this project i create page to search place that can be stay based on property or location. You can try run this website from your local or you can visit this website from this [link without paramater](https://adventure-app-jet.vercel.app) or this link with parameter https://adventure-app-jet.vercel.app/?vercelToolbarCode=WjgkMKMTycTQGfY&name=Fairmont Jakarta&address=Jakarta, Indonesia&id=9000248394&checkin=2024-11-05&checkout=2024-11-06&total_guest=2&total_room=1&location_type=property

## Additional Information
On this project , i have no choice but to skip page for property deals and location stay section because limited time and need to adapt with Nuxt.js. I try in local and it work well with fetching data from api end point in Safari, but in vercel it got problem with CORS. For temporary solution, please try with google chrome and use this [extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf) or try with cognito.
